# house-price-prediction-machine-learning-algorithm

Implementing a linear regression machine learning algorithm to predict
house prices based on historical data.

Given: historical data
Output: predicted price for each houses

Algorithms implemented:
1. Gauss-Jordan Elimination for computing inverses
2. Matrix multiplication, subtraction
3. Matrix subtraction
4. Malloc funciton in C programming
5. file input and ouput

# Instruction:
Once downloaded the codes, save house-price-prediction-machine-learning-algorithm
1. Type 'make' in terminal, then press return
2. Download trainA.txt, testA.txt, and resultA.txt, and save them in the save directory as fourth.c
3. Enter "./fourth trainA.txt testA.txt" in the terminal and press return
4. the resulting house prices should be the same as those in resultA.txt
